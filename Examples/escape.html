<h3>There are 3 characters that need to be escaped in HTML</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The less than character (&lt;)</li>
    <li>The greater than character (&gt;)</li>
    <li>And the ampercent sign (&amp;)</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be escaped by writing an ampercent sign followed by "lt" for less than, "gt" for greater than and "amp" for the ampercent sign, followed by a semi-colon.</p>
<p>ie, &amp;lt; / &amp;gt; / &amp;amp;</p>
<br>
<h4>there are other symbols that can be represented in HTML by referenceing syntax</h4>
<p>for example, the copyright symbol (&copy;) is represented by an ampercent followed by "copy" followed by semi-colon. <br>
ie, &amp;copy;</p>
<p>to represent a non breaking space, so that words between said space will always&nbsp;stay&nbsp;together use &amp;nbsp;</p>
